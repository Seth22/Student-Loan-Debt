# Student-Loan-Debt - A simple Java Program to Calculate student loan debt

## Inputs 
1.Input the student debt amount

2.Input the interest rate 

3.Input the years it will take to pay off the loan - *(This number + ~21 will be the age you are debt free by)* 

## Outputs

1.Output monthly payments

2.Output yearly payments-*(yearly payments can be thought of as directly debuffing your salary)*

3.Output total amount paid 

4.Output total interest paid-*(how much extra money you will pay)*

5.Will also output how the years taken to pay off the loans will effect the above values in increments of 5 starting at 5 and going to 50 

*Please note currently only works in terminal with an IDE but I may create a GUI executable in the future*

## Goals

1.Show how time will exponentially increase cost of a loan

2.Show how time will inverse exponentially decrease the monthly payments

3.Show how time in loan formulas are an example of law of diminishing returns; At first taking longer does not increase total cost much and greatly lowers debt but after only a few years monthly payments are only a reduced a little bit and total cost are greatly increased 

4.Help people understand loan debt and how interest/time/total debt taken out will effect their future life; What ever your yearly payment is view that as nerfing your yearly income every year you owe that debt

## Calculate college cost in a spreadsheet!

**If this is usefully to you please checkout the Spreadsheet templates for calculating college cost with formulas already built in!**

**Under ["College Cost template.ODS"](https://github.com/Seth22/Student-Loan-Debt/blob/main/College%20cost%20template.ods) import it to sheets or excel**

*May work better in google sheets, I created it in Google sheets to calculate my own college cost*

*Hopefully this will help you please enjoy :D -Seth/SJB* 

*Created and tested in IntelliJ IDE other IDEs may require slight tweaks*
