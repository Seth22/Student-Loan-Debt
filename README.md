# Student-Loan-Debt - A simple Java Program to Calculate student loan debt

## Inputs 
1.Input the student debt 

2.Input the interest rate

3.Input the years it will take to pay off the loan

## Outputs

1.Output monthly payments

2.Output yearly payments

3.Output total amount paid 

4.Output total interest paid

5.Will also output how the years taken to pay off the loans will effect the above values in increments of 5 starting at 5 and going to 65 

*Please note currently only works in terminal with an IDE but I may create a GUI executable in the future*

## Goals

1.Show how time will exponentially increase cost of a loan

2.Show how time will inverse exponentially decrease the monthly payments

3.Show how time in loan formulas are an example of law of diminishing returns; At first taking longer does not increase total cost much and greatly lowers debt but after only a few years monthly payments are only a reduced a little bit and total cost are greatly increased 

4. Help people understand loan debt and how interest/time/total debt taken out will effect their future life; What ever your yearly payment is view that as nerfing your yearly income every year you owe that debt

## Calculate college cost in a spreadsheet!

**If this is usefully to you please checkout the Spreadsheet templates for calculating college cost with formulas already built in!**

**Under ["College Cost template.ODS"](https://github.com/Seth22/Student-Loan-Debt/blob/main/College%20cost%20template.ods) import it to sheets or excel**

*May work better in google sheets, I created it in Google sheets to calculate my own college cost*

*Hopefully it will help you please enjoy :D -Seth/SJB*
